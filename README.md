💻 CRUD Web Application using XAMPP (PHP & MySQL)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a basic web application developed using XAMPP, where core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented with a MySQL database. The application includes a search functionality, form validation, and SQL injection prevention techniques, making it a strong foundation project for learning backend web development and security basics.

The user interface is built using HTML with simple CSS, focusing on clarity and functionality rather than advanced design.
